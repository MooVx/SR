2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKBF-1#1 Warning
connects_I_driver_BUFR  
The BUFG cell hdmi_vga_i/dvi2rgb_1/U0/GenerateBUFG.ResyncToBUFG_X/InstBUFG I pin is driven by a BUFR cell hdmi_vga_i/dvi2rgb_1/U0/TMDS_ClockingX/PixelClkBuffer. For 7-Series devices, this is not a recommended clock topology. Please analyze your clock network and remove the BUFR to BUFG cascade.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0 and clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0_1 and clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_hdmi_vga_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ */SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '4' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
